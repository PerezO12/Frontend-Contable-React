# ReportViewer.tsx Runtime Error Fixes - Summary

## Issue Description
The ReportViewer component was throwing a runtime error:
```
"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"
```
This occurred when generating reports, specifically when trying to access properties that might be undefined in the report data.

## Root Cause
The backend API was sometimes returning incomplete report data where certain properties in the `narrative` object and `table` object were undefined, but the frontend code was trying to access them without defensive checks.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Narrative Section Defensive Checks
- **Line ~260**: Added null check for `key_insights` before accessing `.length`
  ```tsx
  // Before: {report.narrative.key_insights.length > 0 && (
  // After: {report.narrative.key_insights && report.narrative.key_insights.length > 0 && (
  ```

- **Line ~280**: Added null check for `recommendations` before accessing `.length`
  ```tsx
  // Before: {report.narrative.recommendations.length > 0 && (
  // After: {report.narrative.recommendations && report.narrative.recommendations.length > 0 && (
  ```

- **Line ~300**: Added null check for `financial_highlights` before accessing `Object.keys()`
  ```tsx
  // Before: {Object.keys(report.narrative.financial_highlights).length > 0 && (
  // After: {report.narrative.financial_highlights && Object.keys(report.narrative.financial_highlights).length > 0 && (
  ```

- **Line ~250**: Added null check for `executive_summary`
  ```tsx
  {report.narrative.executive_summary && (
  ```

### 2. Report Table Section Defensive Checks
- **Line ~215**: Added null checks for `report.table.sections` before mapping
  ```tsx
  // Before: {report.table.sections.map((section, index) => (
  // After: {report.table && report.table.sections && report.table.sections.map((section, index) => (
  ```

- **Line ~220**: Added null checks for `report.table.totals` before accessing
  ```tsx
  // Before: {Object.keys(report.table.totals).length > 0 && (
  // After: {report.table && report.table.totals && Object.keys(report.table.totals).length > 0 && (
  ```

### 3. ReportSectionComponent Defensive Checks
- Added null checks for section data and properties
- Added fallback values for potentially undefined `level` properties
- Added null check for `section.total` before formatting
- Added null check for `section.items` before mapping

### 4. Additional Safety Measures
- Added default values for `level` properties: `level={item.level || 0}`
- Added conditional rendering for section totals: `{section.total ? formatCurrency(section.total) : '-'}`

## Testing
- Created test file `test-report-viewer.tsx` with scenarios for missing data
- Successfully built the application with no TypeScript compilation errors
- All defensive checks prevent runtime errors when encountering undefined data

## Result
The ReportViewer component now handles incomplete or malformed report data gracefully without crashing, providing a better user experience and preventing the application from breaking when the backend returns incomplete narrative data.
